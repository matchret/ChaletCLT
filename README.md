# ChalCLT Project

**ChalCLT** is a software solution developed for the IFT-2007 course in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (Fall 2023). The project is dedicated to providing SOKIO—a company specialized in modeling laminated solid wood walls—with a user-friendly and efficient application. This deliverable focuses on the maintenance and continuous improvement of the initial software.

> **Note:** The application is already compiled and packaged in the `equipe17.jar` file. Simply run this JAR file to launch the application.

## Vision

Our vision is centered on the **maintenance and continuous improvement** of the ChalCLT project. After successfully completing the initial development in four phases—conceptualization, elaboration, construction, and transition—we are now focused on:

- **Ensuring Robustness:** Delivering a stable and efficient solution for modeling laminated solid wood walls.
- **Iterative Enhancements:** Continuously updating the application based on user feedback and evolving industry requirements.
- **User-Centric Approach:** Maintaining an intuitive interface and precise data representation for an optimal user experience.

## Accessory Management

**Note:** Accessories are added to the current view. If you try to add an accessory in the top view, nothing will happen.

**To add an accessory:**
1. Navigate to the **Accessory** tab.
2. Click on the **Add** button.
3. Fill in the fields with the desired dimensions.
4. Click on the **Enter** button.

**To modify an accessory:**
1. Click on the accessory you wish to modify from the list.
2. Click on the **Modify** button.
3. Enter the new values in the fields.
4. Click on the **Enter** button.

**To delete an accessory:**
1. Click on the accessory you want to delete.
2. Click on the **Delete** button.

## Conclusion

The ChalCLT application offers several strengths for chalet modeling:

- **User Interface:** A simple and consistent interface that facilitates quick adoption.
- **Precision:** Accurate data regarding wall dimensions and accessories.
- **Efficiency:** Effective tools for model visualization and manipulation.

Identified areas for improvement include:

- Simplifying the accessory modification panels for smoother usability.
- Enhancing the graphical representation to ensure precise visualization of the entered data.
- Fixing visual bugs to maintain data integrity.
- Implementing an auto-save feature to protect data in case of accidental application closure.

By addressing these aspects, ChalCLT will be further optimized to meet the specific needs of the industry, providing SOKIO with a reliable and high-performing solution.
